# SpectralAnalysisTutorial
A tutorial on spectral analysis for psychologists and social scientists.

In 'dummy_example/' there is  executable.py which makes running a spectral analysis easy.

To use simply open up the .py file and edit the settings (e.g. filename, individual/dyadic analysis etc.) and run.
